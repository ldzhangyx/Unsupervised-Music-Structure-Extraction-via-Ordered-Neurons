# Unsupervised Music Structure Extraction via Ordered Neurons

## Features:

- A very first program on unsupervised music structure parsing
- Support note-level parsing and chord level parsing
- Support Nottingham Dataset, Billboard Dataset, HookTheory Melody/Chord Dataset
- Provide a MIDI/numpy transfer toolkit
- Provide a **visualization toolkit** for parse trees.

# Quick Start

We do not provide the numpy format of dataset, so you could transfer the origin Nottingham dataset to the numpy format using our toolkit.

```
python main.py
```

and you can have a try then.
